PROJECT NOVA is an interactive, browser-based game designed to teach Python fundamentals to kids or other programming beginners through an engaging futuristic hacker narrative. Solve challenges and hack your way through the system directly in your browser.

## About The Project

This game was developed as a capstone project for a technology internship at an experiential learning institute. Its primary goal is to provide a fun and engaging way to teach the fundamentals of Python to kids and teens aged 9-15.

## Built With
